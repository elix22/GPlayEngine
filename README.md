# GPlayEngine
GPlayEngine is a C++ cross-platform game engine for creating 2D/3D games.

GPlayEngine is based on the [GamePlay 3D engine](http://www.gameplay3d.io/) v3.0 and principally replace the OpenGL 2.x backend to use the [BGFX](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx) graphic framework.

## Current status
- cmake is used as main build system (qtcreator is also up-to-date)
- bgfx integration is completed and replace opengl.
- bgfx is currently forced to use the opengl driver because engine still use some old glsl shaders. A pass on shaders is planned to use the bgfx shader syntax to be fully compatible with others bgfx backends.
- Engine now use SDL2 by default to manage windows and inputs. Gamepad are not yet implanted.
- Lua is temporarily disabled to speed up the compilation during core dev phase.
- All previous samples and demo are now working with the new renderer.
- A new sample "sample-graphics" is used to test bgfx conversion and new features.
- Only tested on Linux, Windows and Emscripten for now.


## Install submodules dependencies

Some thirdparty libraries are registered as submodules, you need to install them before building engine.
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

## Building
See [wiki - compiling framework](https://github.com/fredakilla/GPlayEngine/wiki/Compiling-framework) for build instructions.
